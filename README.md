# Android-Studio-Games

This presents users with an interface and four games to choose from. Each of the games is focus, memory, or attention-based.
The goal of each of these is to reduce distractibility in ADHD patients after the game is played on a daily basis for at least 
a month. 

**These games were built for the UC Davis MIND Institute as apart of their DeLTa research initiative**
